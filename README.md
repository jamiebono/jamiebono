**Data Infrastructure Consulting | Healthcare Systems | Former Paramedic**

I help organizations make good decisions about their data systems—whether that means building custom infrastructure, implementing vendor solutions, or walking away from bad deals and exploitation.

## Background

Started as a paramedic. Best training possible for data engineering—pattern recognition under incomplete information, understanding when systems are about to fail, and knowing the difference between "I don't know" and confident bullshit.

Spent years seeing the same patients for the same problems because healthcare treats medical emergencies without addressing the housing instability, food insecurity, and transportation barriers that caused them. Graduate work in disaster planning and Medicaid redesign let me validate with data what I'd observed on the frontline: these patterns are systemic, not anecdotal.

**University at Buffalo** – Built NLP systems for clinical note extraction and genomics data pipelines. Learned the difference between AI that works in vendor demos and AI that works with messy 3am clinical documentation.

**Consulting & Startup Experience** – Saw how most organizations get sold technology solutions for workflow problems. Watched venture capital extract value from nonprofits while calling it partnership. Left to focus on work that actually matters.

## What I Do

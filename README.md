**Data Infrastructure & AI Consulting | Healthcare Systems | Former Paramedic**

I help organizations make good decisions about their data systems, whether that means building custom infrastructure, implementing vendor solutions, or walking away from bad deals.

## Background

I started as a paramedic, which turned out to be excellent preparation for consulting. Emergency medicine teaches you to recognize patterns with incomplete information, to know when a system is failing before anyone says so, and to be honest about what you don't know. Those skills transfer surprisingly well.

For years I saw the same patients coming back for the same problems, because healthcare treats the medical emergency without addressing the housing instability, food insecurity, and transportation barriers behind it. I went to graduate school to study disaster planning and Medicaid redesign, where I could validate with data what I'd been watching happen on every shift. The patterns were systemic, not anecdotal, and I wanted to work on the systems.

At the University at Buffalo I studied biomedical informatics, which is where I got into the work I do now. I built NLP pipelines for clinical note extraction and genomics data processing, worked with ontologies and knowledge graphs for structuring biomedical data, and learned how information architecture determines whether a system actually works or just looks good in a demo. That's also where I developed a strong opinion about the difference between AI that performs well in controlled presentations and AI that has to deal with messy clinical documentation at three in the morning.

After that I spent time in consulting and startups, where I saw a repeating pattern: organizations getting sold technology solutions for what were really workflow and information design problems. I watched venture capital extract value from nonprofits while calling it partnership. Eventually I decided to focus on work where I could be genuinely useful.

## What I Do

I'm a Senior Data Engineer and Principal Consultant at **[EmergenceTek Group Inc.](https://emergencetek.com/)** My work sits at the intersection of data infrastructure, information architecture, and applied AI.

On the infrastructure side, I lead enterprise data platform assessments and build analytics systems on Azure, Databricks, and Microsoft Fabric. I do a lot of healthcare analytics, including member attribution, cohort analysis, and specialty pharmacy work. I handle SharePoint remediation for large multi-terabyte environments, API integration, and ETL pipeline design.

The part of my work I find most interesting right now is context engineering and agentic AI architecture, which pulls together most of what I've learned across my career. I design the information structures that make AI systems actually useful: ontologies and knowledge graphs that give agents something to reason over, information architectures that determine what gets retrieved and how, governance layers like Microsoft Purview that control what sensitive data AI can access and how it's classified. The underlying problem is always the same, whether you're building a data platform or an agentic workflow: if you don't get the information architecture right, nothing downstream works well. I build and run agentic systems regularly, so when I talk to clients about this work, I'm drawing on practical experience, not theory.

My technical stack includes Python, SQL, Azure, Databricks, Microsoft Fabric, Power BI, Microsoft Purview, and Neo4j. My domain experience spans Medicaid and managed care, biomedical informatics, genomics, ontology design, knowledge graph architecture, social determinants of health measurement, and data sovereignty for nonprofits.

Before EmergenceTek, I was Chief Reporting Officer at Millennium Collaborative Care, a homeland security research fellow, and worked in disaster planning for vulnerable populations. I currently serve on the Board of Directors for [CCNY, Inc.](https://www.ccnyinc.org/) in Buffalo, NY, a nonprofit that provides data analysis, program evaluation, and capacity-building services to health and human service organizations.
